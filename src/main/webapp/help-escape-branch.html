  Optional.<br/>
  If this is set, any invalid characters in the branch name above are replaced by _ before setting sonar.branch<br/>
  For example, if you specify ${GIT_BRANCH} above, the branch will be something like "origin/master", which is not a valid sonar branch.
  If you check this option, however, it will be changed to "origin_master", which is something sonar will accept.
